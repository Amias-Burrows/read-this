He has been keeping his head down at work so he doesn't get outcasted by everyone there
He's loved space since he was very little
Nearby space center museum has model rockets and a prototype from when the space center wanted to make a small shuttle to go from the ground to the ISS without wastage

The main character has a chip insterted into his head and his right hand has been replaced with a mechanical hand.  Her role as a slave would be to service her master (in more than one way).  The chip and mechanical hand is to be able to connect to the network and complete tasks her master gives her.  
Also means she is able to understand different languages and speak them too.  This only works when the ship is within range and switched on because the chip itsself can't contain everything.
